ASU Graders:

The code for this assignment was derived solely from Bill's lectures and Module 15 files.

Bill actually did kind of a branstorming session lecture where he discusses some things we never went over in class. 
I hope you're able to open everything up and please feel free to reach out with any questions or comments.
